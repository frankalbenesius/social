# Social

This is a social media experiment.

It was scaffolded using create-react-app.

## Available Commands:

- `npm start` starts the development server
- `npm build` bundles the app into static files for production
- `npm test` runs tests... we will figure out what tests we find important later
- `npm eject` don't do this... ejects from the create-react-app environment

## To run locally:

1. Clone repository.
1. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
1. Create a `.env` environment variables file to store firebase project information. Match the provided `.env.example` variables.
1. Start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
