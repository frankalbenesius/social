# Social

This is a social media experiment.

It was scaffolded using create-react-app.

## Available Commands:

- `npm start` starts the development server
- `npm build` bundles the app into static files for production
- `npm test` runs tests... we will figure out what tests we find important later
- `npm eject` don't do this... ejects from the create-react-app environment
